Xvidmode
========

Xvidmode is a tool to get the current or all X video modes. It can also
be used to set different video modes.

Build & Install
---------------

Just type `make install`.

Xvidmode, for what?
-------------------

Well, I've got a lot of video modes (actually 15) and I didn't like to
press the `<CTRL>+<ALT>+<KEYPAD>` combo to switch to another video mode, it's
very boring switch from 1152x800 to 512x384 video mode, so I create Xvidmode.
